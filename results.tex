\section{Expected Results}
\label{sec:results}


This project will develop new insights that reveal the extent of content
moderation policies and practices across a wide spectrum of platforms. 
First, the proposed research will build the first
public, large-scale, longitudinal, annotated corpus of content moderation
rules across platforms.
Second, this project will shed light on
users' awareness of and experiences with content moderation rules, helping to
inform the public about how both the rules and policies---and their
implementations---differ both across platforms, and even across different
situations and circumstances on the same platform.
Finally, this project will gather empirical evidence of 
how content moderation is implemented across various platforms, as well as
whether such implementations are clear and consistent. In this vein, the
research is an interdisciplinary activity relying on expertise across a range
of disciplines, including large-scale measurement, natural language
processing, human computer interaction, law and policy; the PIs have deep
 expertise in all of these areas and a long history of working together at
 these disciplinary boundaries.
